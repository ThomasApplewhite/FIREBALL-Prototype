====== ProgressionDevelopment ======
Created Saturday 14 October 2023

The game needs some progession. Right now, that includes:

The functionality we need for that is spells reducing player health, but the real work that's needed is:
[*] Level-to-level progression: full intended level end
	[*] Disable Spawns while out of level
	[*] Pop up a button to continue the game
		[*] More condensed/methodical start game method
	[*] Restart spawns and scale things when pressed
	[*] Disable Spellcasting between levels
[*] A start menu
[*] the ability to pause
[*] spells that consume health^{1}
[*] enemy scaling
[x] a way to get more spells^{2}
[*] math for spell progression rates^{3}



1. I am going to wait on this until I refactor spells to be generated of an internally held spell data resource, rather than premade scenes
2. This needs there to be more spells so I guess that's a task too. Or, maybe we just use dummy zaps for right now. I can add more spells as needed
	a. jk I am not doing this
3. Check the [[DesignDocs:ProgressionDesignBrainstormFromGym]] page for this mat

I'll need to figure out more functionality that GameState needs to handle. Maybe it can initialize Player and Enemy scaling?
I think that is what I did. I also need to spend time figuring out how the game will progress from a mathematical perspective
