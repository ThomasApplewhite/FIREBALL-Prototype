[ ] Refactor GameState level control for cleanliness
[ ] Mathematically align/rearrange main menu elements
[*] Change DevScene to be a Node OR create production play scene that is a node (rather than a Node2D)
[*] Custom Splash Screen. It's cute that way!
[ ] Change Spells to render on top of enemies
	[ ] And UI to render on top of enemies
[ ] Decide if all spell functionality should focus its data into a spelldata node on the spell, and individual functionality nodes (mover, damage dealer, etc) just call getters on that spell data node to get their information/data/etc. 
	* If I did that, then maybe spell_factory can do even more spell generation so I don't need spell scenes. That'd be cool
	* I could also have a custom initializer node and a custom properties dict so that way I could just initialize my node in a custom way if I needed extra functionality. Hm...
	* Hell maybe even special data classes that have the custom initialization stuff in them??? Lots of thoughts here. Figure this out later though.
	* My fear that this is unperformant can be blunted by pooling spell instances ahead of time so they all generate at the same time. So if that happens, I can start doing spell pooling sooner
