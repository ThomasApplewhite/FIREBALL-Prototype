[x] Refactor GameState level control for cleanliness
	* On closer review there's really not much to do here
[ ] Mathematically align/rearrange main menu elements
[*] Change DevScene to be a Node OR create production play scene that is a node (rather than a Node2D)
[*] Custom Splash Screen. It's cute that way!
[*] Change Spells to render on top of enemies
	[*] And UI to render on top of enemies
[*] Decide if all spell functionality should focus its data into a spelldata node on the spell, and individual functionality nodes (mover, damage dealer, etc) just call getters on that spell data node to get their information/data/etc. 
	* More info in [[+SpellUnificationRefactor]]
[ ] Make the fireball face straight forward instead of being tilted
