Necessary polish for the game to be easily workable for me in the future. Mostly refactors.

[ ] Refactor Spell Health Costs/Healing so that the whole "positive for damage, negative to heal" thing isn't there it confuses me I don't like it
[ ] Refactor Global Cooldown Modifier so I can easily tell what the modifiers are doing
[ ] Switch preloaded classes like HealthCounter and GameState to be class_name'd.
	* Exceptions can be for data types, since loading those ahead of time is probably a reasonable thing to do.
	[*] GameState
	[ ] HealthCounter
[*] More efficient and cleaner buff access in PlayerBuffCounter, probably through the resource type itself
