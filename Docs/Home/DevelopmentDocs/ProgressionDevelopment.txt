====== ProgressionDevelopment ======
Created Saturday 14 October 2023

The game needs some progession. Right now, that includes:

The functionality we need for that is spells reducing player health, but the real work that's needed is:
[*] Level-to-level progression: full intended level end
	[*] Disable Spawns while out of level
	[*] Pop up a button to continue the game
		[*] More condensed/methodical start game method
	[*] Restart spawns and scale things when pressed
	[*] Disable Spellcasting between levels
[ ] A start menu
[ ] the ability to pause
[ ] spells that consume health
[ ] enemy scaling
[ ] a way to get more spells
[ ] math for spell progression rates.





I'll need to figure out more functionality that GameState needs to handle. Maybe it can initialize Player and Enemy scaling?
