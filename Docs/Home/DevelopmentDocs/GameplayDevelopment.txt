I've figured out all the basic stuff, so now what?

I think what I want to do is have a bunch of spells to pick from, and that each spell has shared properties, and that casting a spell modifies the CD of other spells until you can cast the fireball.

[ ] Spell Selector^{1}
[ ] Zap spell assets^{2}
[ ] Basic Spell B^{2}
[ ] Basic Spell C^{2}
[ ] The FIREBALL^{2}
[ ] Win State

1. What even goes into the spell selector?
[*] Spell Selection UI element
[*] Auto-Generate Elements from list of spell nodes? No, from some sort of data structure that contains a packed scene and spell data. A resource that does that, yeah
[ ] Cooldown managment^{3}
[ ] Global cooldown modification for spell CDs^{3}
[*] Somehow get spells to not cast when the buttons are selected

2. What do spells even need
* Sprites
* SFX
* Icons for the spell selector
* Maybe some VFX? I'll decide later

3. Multiple spells should be implemented before doing this

I'll need to work on screen layout to make all the buttons fit and stuff. So, time to work on screen layout
