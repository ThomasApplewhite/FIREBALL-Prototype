Created Saturday 23 September 2023

[ ] Fix the SpellFuncationality spelling error^{1}
[ ] Visual Indicator for spell cooldowns
[ ] Refactor Spell Health Costs/Healing so that the whole "positive for damage, negative to heal" thing isn't there it confuses me I don't like it
[ ] Organize 'Functionality' Folder^{1}
[ ] Screen Layout/Screen Size pass
[ ] More efficient and cleaner buff access in PlayerBuffCounter, probably through the resource type itself
[ ] Switch preloaded classes like HealthCounter and GameState to be class_name'd.
	* Exceptions can be for data types, since loading those ahead of time is probably a reasonable thing to do.
	[*] GameState
	[ ] HealthCounter
[ ] Resolve on-open file change with magic top data
