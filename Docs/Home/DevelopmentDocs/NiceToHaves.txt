Created Saturday 23 September 2023

[ ] Fix the SpellFuncationality spelling error^{1}
[ ] Visual Indicator for spell cooldowns
[ ] Refactor Spell Health Costs/Healing so that the whole "positive for damage, negative to heal" thing isn't there it confuses me I don't like it
[ ] Refactor Global Cooldown Modifier so I can easily tell what the modifiers are doing
[ ] Organize 'Functionality' Folder^{1}
[ ] Screen Layout/Screen Size pass
[*] More efficient and cleaner buff access in PlayerBuffCounter, probably through the resource type itself
[ ] Switch preloaded classes like HealthCounter and GameState to be class_name'd.
	* Exceptions can be for data types, since loading those ahead of time is probably a reasonable thing to do.
	[*] GameState
	[ ] HealthCounter
[ ] Resolve on-open file change with magic top data
[ ] Add black bottom edge/margin to splash screen
[ ] Disable texture filering on splash screen
[ ] Second pass on art/anim/visuals for Twist of Fate
[ ] A backboard that destroys spells that fly for too long
[ ] Figure out why so many sprites look like their blacks are slightly lighter than the background black in Godot
[ ] Second pass on sprite thickness for Ice Spike
[ ] Even More Balance Work!
	[ ] Better Scaling for FIREBALL's cooldown
	[ ] Better Balancing for spell values
	[ ] Ease-of-Use features for computer testing of spells (easier spell picking, like with a keyboard or something)
[ ] Move Enemy scaling out of Enemy.gd and into something more sensical


1. Godot 4.1 has been know to crash/corrupt projects during renames/moves. Do this later.
