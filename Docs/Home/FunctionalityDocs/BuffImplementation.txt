====== BuffImplementation ======
Created Thursday 26 October 2023

	* If buff systems are stored in GameState (or a child), anything that gets buffed regularly needs access to it. However, that might only need to be three things:
		* A custom script for managing the player's health cap and regen
		* Spell functionality, for adjusting spell damage
		* Some part of spell provider, to messw ith cooldowns
			* Cooldowns are hardest, as they are cached early in the game. Do these ever get reset? Probably not, right? Maybe there's a way I can change cooldown so it can adjust the base cooldown with the new cooldown rate.


How can systems globably access the buff counters and amounts?
How should each system use the buff values?

Something I'm concerned about preloading the buff counter too much. But do I really need to?
PlayerFunctionality is a good singular place for a buff counter preload.
PlayerFunctionality can reach the player's health and health regen. Quite easily.
How do we get the counter to the player's spell CD and Damage?
SpellFunctionality is a good place for damage, since spells are also player specific. It's also possible that preload is only a performance or memory drag per script its preloaded in, rather than instance.

Wait, should I be preloading for statics or doing classnames? Which is more appropriate?
Looks like it shoud be class name.  I guess I should refactor those things.
But if the Buff Counter is a class_name, we can just pull it in anything player-specific.
So the damage thing can be in spell_func, CD can be somewhere in spell provider

Facts:
* All Buffs are Multipliers
* The Buff System will provide the correct multiplier via function. The result is always valid and functional.
