====== BuffImplementation ======
Created Thursday 26 October 2023

	* If buff systems are stored in GameState (or a child), anything that gets buffed regularly needs access to it. However, that might only need to be three things:
		* A custom script for managing the player's health cap and regen
		* Spell functionality, for adjusting spell damage
		* Some part of spell provider, to messw ith cooldowns
			* Cooldowns are hardest, as they are cached early in the game. Do these ever get reset? Probably not, right? Maybe there's a way I can change cooldown so it can adjust the base cooldown with the new cooldown rate.


How can systems globably access the buff counters and amounts?
How should each system use the buff values?

Facts:
* All Buffs are Multipliers
* The Buff System will provide the correct multiplier via function. The result is always valid and functional.
