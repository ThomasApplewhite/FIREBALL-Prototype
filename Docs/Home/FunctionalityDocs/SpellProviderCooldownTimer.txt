====== SpellProviderCooldownTimer ======
Created Wednesday 27 September 2023

tl;dr:
use 1 global 100,000 second float timer
have an array with 1 index per spell
array entry will contain time at last spell cast
when a spell is cast, if timer is greater than value + that spell's cooldown or is less than value (if timer looped), spell is castable
global CD changes modify the value of the timer to effect all spell cooldowns
if timer reaches 100,000, it will reset to 0 (if timer + delta > 100,000, timer = delta)

potential issue:
if timer value is reduced to be less than the timer's value when a spell is cast, its cooldown will "reset" when it shouldn't
	WRONG: timer value is never reduced
if timer gets looped, everything will reset


different idea: use a singular timer for judging spell times, but when it expires, update the cooldown times of all the spells to represent them getting "looped"
when the timer gets decreased pass zero, just do the looping manually and don't even change the timer

as for cooldown graphics, dont sweat doing them as a for loop. If its really too  much of a performance drag, I can deal with that later

Bit of a problem: cooldown mods work right now for reducing cooldown values, but not for increasing them.
If a spell is fully cooled down, increasing the cooldown by x will not set that spell's cooldown to x.

I could manually increase cooldowns for positive cooldown values, I guess.
OR I could design everything around only reducing cooldowns

neither seem very cash money/what I want to be doing. Let me think...
OR I could do nothing

Maybe I let players leverage "stacks" of spells. Get your CD reduction so high you can just cast 90 FIREBALLs in a row.

Yeah. That sounds like the most fun choice.

I just need to change cooldown logic to modify the current cooldown amount, not reset it.
