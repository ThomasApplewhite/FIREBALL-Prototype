How should I test the Android APKs?

Waydroid doesn't seem to work. Anbox is discontinued. What should I do? What stuff does Godot have for this?

Oh hey one-click deploys! Nice!

Android UI layout is also not right atm. I can't test literally this instant because I don't have my phone rn, but the answer is correctly using my controls better to FORCE being the full size of the screen.
I may also need to change how the UI elements work out to make them bigger. Use Anchors to determine margins, I think? I still dob't get Godot UI.

Okay it looks like Anchors determine how much nodes stretch, while their size is obviously their size.
