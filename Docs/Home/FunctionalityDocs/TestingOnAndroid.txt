How should I test the Android APKs?

Waydroid doesn't seem to work. Anbox is discontinued. What should I do? What stuff does Godot have for this?

Oh hey one-click deploys! Nice!

Android UI layout is also not right atm. I can't test literally this instant because I don't have my phone rn, but the answer is correctly using my controls better to FORCE being the full size of the screen.
I may also need to change how the UI elements work out to make them bigger. Use Anchors to determine margins, I think? I still dob't get Godot UI.

Okay it looks like Anchors determine how much nodes stretch, while their size is obviously their size.

The  problem with the level elements is that they're viewport size sensitive. Where they go depends on how big the viewport is. Hmm.
Do I actually want to do that? Maybe I should adjust the camera depending on viewport size? I actually kinda don't know what I should do. Hmm...
What if I had a force camera size and it just stretched? This is something I should think about.

Really, the entire game is screen size  sensitive, but I don't think I'm going to worry  about that for right now.
Mostly, player position, enemy spawner size, and UI need to be adjusted for the viewport.

Okay got it I just needed to mess with the screen stretch mode it doesn't look //great// but I don't really care.


Zap and Cooldown Buff are both too strong. Potential fixes:
* Decrease Zap's cooldown mod
* Increase Enemy Speed
* Increase Enemy Health
* Increase FIREBALL scaling speed

We want to avoid players just picking cooldown and spamming zap the whole time.
(it might be worth writeing this info down and making small changes, but pushing the first build unbalanced so I can get people to play it anyways)
