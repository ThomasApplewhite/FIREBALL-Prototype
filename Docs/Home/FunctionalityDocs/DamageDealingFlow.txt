Created Saturday 23 September 2023

Damage is dealt in this order of events:
1. Object B enters Object A
2. Object A has a DamageDealer node that is signal-connected to a collision area
3. Object A's DamageDealer checks for Object B's health on "^HealthCounter"
4. If found, Object A's DamageDealer calls Object B's HealthCounter.decrease_health()
