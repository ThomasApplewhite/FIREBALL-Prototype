====== SpellFactory and Spell Instancing ======
Created Saturday 07 October 2023

How are spells instanced? Great question!

When the player clicks to cast a spell, player_functionality calls cast_spell.
cast_spell calls spell_provider.cast_selected_spell
cast_selected_spell calls spell_factory.create_spell_instance

spell_factory.create_spell_instance() instances spells based on saved spell data.
It then access the spell's SpellFunctionality node to make spell sub-node data changes.
If the SpellFactory wants to make changes to a spell's nodes, it can access them through SpellFunctionality.

It's up to the spell author to make sure SpellFunctionality has its exports are set so that SpellFactory can access the needed nodes.
