How do I launch spells? Spell launching functionality should be in  LinearSpellMover or some other spell movement thing, but there's no easy way to access them.
But the thing is that each spell has to have a 'launch' method and they all need to have access to their spell movers anyways to make that start.
Is there any way to fix both of those birds with one stone?

How can the spell mover node of a spell be accessed without needing to refer to an explicit name?

Okay, idea: What if spells have a spell functionality node, and THAT has access to everything. It works for health counter, I guess.

Yes, let'd do that. A "spell functionality" node that gives access to general spell functionality and components, and that has a static path accessor like GameState.
