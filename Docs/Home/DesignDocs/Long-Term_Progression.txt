FIREBALL is a factory game, in a sense, where each spell generates cooldown reduction or damage.

A skilled player will be able to manage the growth of these rates to work up to casting FIREBALLs near constantly.

Question: Will players get stat increases and spell upgrades and different spells to spike these rates and build these engines, or will it be a puzzle strategy game where the initial rates and spells are set up so that the player can reach a spun-up super FIREBALL generator for large level clears? So it's more of a puzzle to figure out a way to build the most efficient spell engine to get lots of FIREBALLs without dying in the meantime?

You should research engine building games and learn som quick tips for designing them. Or, idk, make it up.
