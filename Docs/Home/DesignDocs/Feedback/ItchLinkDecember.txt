3 players, as far as I can tell

--Copy Pasted--
One player on Linux, one on Windows

How far were you able to get?
2 responses
Pressed the cool down button twice after winning and basically auto won every game after that. 
tested using numpad for spells, windows 10.  Got to enemies having 300 health before i realized spell #3 does damage to myself and killed myself.  Did not read the spell rules going in, my fault LMAO.

Did you encounter any bugs or glitches while playing?
2 responses
None
no bugs or glitches, however I would mention that the second and fourth spells have a max range, as they dont show up for further enemies. 

Do you have any feedback on what you think might improve the game?
2 responses
Spawn less enemies in quick succession / increase fireball timer 
beyond the feedback I left for the Linux testing (slower/less enemies and longer cooldown for fireball?) I think sound would be nice as an indicator for lessening health or an indicator that fireball is ready

--Handwritten notes from Chloe--
Chloe played on Linux

Bugs:
twist of fate sprite stuck on screen
upgrades dont reset after retry
game can crash at high upgrade levels?

Chloe Notes:
Doesn't like that FIREBALL cooldown penalties exist
Cooldown feels like the best upgrade
Players should know when Cooldown upgrade maxes

My Notes:
Chloe doesn't know the point of the game. She didn't read the page desceiprion, but there's also no in game explanation
CHLOE DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT SPELL STACKING. THAT'S ACTUALLY A HUGE BLINDSPOT
